    "contents" : "Shiny is an R package created by RStudio that enabled R users to create an interactive web application that utilizes R as the background engine. Through default methods to build user interface elements in HTML and a handle to the server side code, Shiny is a very simple way to turn R code into a website. \n\nThis tool uses the Shiny functionality to create user controls, pass correctly formatted data to the client (and thus usable by javascript), and as a means to display summary information regarding the user's interactions with a graph at any point in time. In this context, Shiny serves as the translator between the formatted data and what the user sees and interacts with on their screen.",
