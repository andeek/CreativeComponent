D3 is a javascript library written by Mike Bostock with the main purpose of visualizing and interacting with data.\cite{mb-d3} The title D3 stands for ``Data Driven Documents‚Äù. This library facilitates manipulation of HTML elements, SVG (scalable vector graphics), and CSS (cascading style sheets) with the end goal of animations and interactions that are tied to underlying data. The key idea behind the library is that DOM elements are completely determined by the data, so rather than adding elements to a web page to be viewed by users, D3 allows users to see and interact with graphical representaions of their data in a web framework. 

This tool uses D3 to handle all graphical displays and user interactions with the graph. The data is passed to the client and able to be used through Shiny's input bindings. It is crucial that the data has been formatted correctly at this point for the javascript to properly function. For this reason, we limit the file types being passed in to the tool to a robust graph-specific type.

At this point in the page lifecycle, the graph's nodes are tied to circles and the edges are tied to paths on the page. User manipulations such as selecting, dragging, and grouping are handled by D3 and then data is passed back to the server via Shiny's output bindings to allow for communication between user and the R engine underneath. What this means is that all visualization and user interaction with the graph are accomplished using javascript, more specifically the library D3. Shiny and R serve as the framework on which the data sits, but when the user touches the data they are doing so through the javascript pieces.
